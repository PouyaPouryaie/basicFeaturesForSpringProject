## Free Book: OpenSSL Cookbook

A free book on OpenSSL is available online: [OpenSSL Cookbook, by Ivan RistiÄ‡](https://www.feistyduck.com/library/openssl-cookbook/)

----

## MS Windows

### Install OpenSSL
For MS Windows, you need to install OpenSSL

1. In your web browser, visit the link: https://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html

2. In the table, move to the entry: **Win64 OpenSSL v1.1.x Light**. 

3. Select the **MSI** download link

3. Once downloadeded to your computer, run the MSI file

4. During the installation process, select all of the defaults.

5. Update your system path environment variable to point to the openssl installation

    a. Open the MS Windows Control Panel

    b. Select **System > Advanced System Settings**

    c. Click **Environment Variables**

    d. In the **System variables** section, select the **Path** variable and click the **Edit** button.

    e. At the beginning of the path, add: `c:\Program Files\OpenSSL-Win64\bin;`

    > **_NOTE:_** Be sure to update with the installation directory on your computer accordingly.
    f. Click **Ok** and proceed to close all of the dialogs.

### Verify OpenSSL installation

Let's verify the OpenSSL installation

1. Open a new command-prompt window.

2. Type the following command:
    ```
    openssl help
    ```

3. You will see the version of openssl installed. If so then openssl is installed successfully. :-)


### Generate Key and Self-Signed Certificate

1. Open a command-prompt window.

2. Move into the directory of your React library project.

    ```
    cd react-library
    ```

3. Create a new directory for your output files

    ```
    mkdir ssl-localhost
    ```

4. Create a configuration file for the OpenSSL utility. 

    a. In the directory: `react-library`
    
    b. Create a new file named: `localhost.conf`

4. Open the `localhost.conf` file and enter the following:
    ```
    [req]
    # Don't prompt the user when running openssl certificate generation
    prompt = no
    # Reference to the section containing the Distinguished Name (information about your company/entity)
    distinguished_name = dn
    [dn]
    # Country, State and Locality (city)
    C = US
    ST = Pennsylvania
    L = Philadelphia
    # Organization and Organizational Unit (department name, group name)
    O = luv2code
    OU = Training
    # Common Name (fully qualified domain name of your website server)
    CN = localhost
    ```

5. Save the file.

6. In the terminal window, run this command to generate the key and certificate. _Be sure to enter this command as a single line._

    ```
    openssl req -x509 -out ssl-localhost\localhost.crt -keyout ssl-localhost\localhost.key -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -sha256 -days 365 -config localhost.conf
    ```

    | Argument | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | req -x509 | generate X.509 certificate |
    | -out ssl-localhost/localhost.crt | name of output certificate file |
    | -keyout ssl-localhost/localhost.key | name of output key file |
    | -newkey rsa:2048 | create new certificate request and a new private key using algorithm RSA and key size of 2048 bits |
    |-nodes | No DES encryption. The generated private key will not be encrypted |
    | -sha256 | Use the SHA256 message digest to sign the request
    | -days 365 | Certificate is valid for 365 days |
    | -config localhost.conf | Name of config file |

    > Detailed docs available [here](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man1/openssl-req.html). 

6. This command generates the following output:
    ```
    Generating a 2048 bit RSA private key
    .......+++
    ...............................+++
    writing new private key to 'ssl-localhost/localhost.key'
    ```

7. The command generates two files: `localhost.crt` and `localhost.key`.

8. View the newly generated files in the `ssl-locahost` directory.

    ```
    dir ssl-localhost
    ```
    
    _Sample output_
    ```
    localhost.crt   localhost.key
    ```

9. View the contents of your certificate.

    ```
    openssl x509 -noout -text -in ssl-localhost/localhost.crt
    ```

    _Sample Output_
    ```    
    Certificate:
        Data:
            Version: ...
            Serial Number: 13535095018565170476 (0xbbd6513516bc752c)

## Mac or Linux

On Mac/Linux, openssl is already included with the operating system. There is nothing additional to install.

### Generate Key and Self-Signed Certificate

1. Open a terminal window.

2. Move into the directory of your React library project.

    ```
    cd react-library
    ```

3. Create a new directory for your output files.

    ```
    mkdir ssl-localhost
    ```

4. Create a configuration file for the OpenSSL utility. 

    a. In the directory: `react-library`
    
    b. Create a new file named: `localhost.conf`

4. Open the `localhost.conf` file and enter the following:
    ```
    [req]
    # Don't prompt the user when running openssl certificate generation
    prompt = no
    # Reference to the section containing the Distinguished Name (information about your company/entity)
    distinguished_name = dn
    [dn]
    # Country, State and Locality (city)
    C = US
    ST = Pennsylvania
    L = Philadelphia
    # Organization and Organizational Unit (department name, group name)
    O = luv2code
    OU = Training
    # Common Name (fully qualified domain name of your website server)
    CN = localhost
    ```

5. Save the file.

6. In the terminal window, run this command to generate the key and certificate.

    ```
    openssl req -x509 \
      -out ssl-localhost/localhost.crt \
      -keyout ssl-localhost/localhost.key \
      -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -sha256 -days 365 \
      -config localhost.conf
    ```
    | Argument | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | req -x509 | generate X.509 certificate |
    | -out ssl-localhost/localhost.crt | name of output certificate file |
    | -keyout ssl-localhost/localhost.key | name of output key file |
    | -newkey rsa:2048 | create new certificate request and a new private key using algorithm RSA and key size of 2048 bits |
    |-nodes | No DES encryption. The generated private key will not be encrypted |
    | -sha256 | Use the SHA256 message digest to sign the request
    | -days 365 | Certificate is valid for 365 days |
    | -config localhost.conf | Name of config file |

    > Detailed docs available [here](https://www.openssl.org/docs/man1.1.1/man1/openssl-req.html). 
5. This command will generate the following output:
    ```
    Generating a 2048 bit RSA private key
    .......+++
    ...............................+++
    writing new private key to 'ssl-localhost/localhost.key'
    ```

7. The command generates two files: `localhost.crt` and `localhost.key`.

8. View the newly generated files in the `ssl-localhost` directory.

    ```
    ls ssl-localhost
    ```

    _Sample output_
    ```
    localhost.crt   localhost.key
    ```

9. View the contents of your certificate.

    ```
    openssl x509 -noout -text -in ssl-localhost/localhost.crt
    ```

    _Sample Output_
    ```

        Data:
            Version: ...
